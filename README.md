🚗 Banff Traffic & Parking Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

Banff experiences heavy traffic and parking congestion during peak tourist seasons.
The goal of this project was to use machine learning to predict traffic volume and parking occupancy so congestion can be managed more effectively.

This project was completed as part of CMPT 3835 – Work Integrated Learning II.

🎯 Problem Statement

Parking lots in Banff often reach full capacity unexpectedly

Traffic congestion increases during peak hours and seasons

City planners and staff need early predictions to take action

💡 Solution

I built a data-driven machine learning system that:

Predicts hourly parking occupancy

Identifies when parking reaches near-full levels

Provides insights through a deployed dashboard

🧠 Key Features

Cleaned and merged multiple Banff datasets

Engineered time-based features (hour, day, season)

Trained and compared multiple ML models

Selected the best-performing model

Deployed predictions using Streamlit

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest

Streamlit

Matplotlib / Seaborn

GitHub

📊 Machine Learning Models
Regression

Predicts number of parked vehicles per hour

Best model achieved low prediction error

Classification

Predicts whether parking is near full

Useful as an alert system for congestion

🚀 Deployment

Model deployed using Streamlit

Interactive interface for live predictions

Helps visualize trends and risk periods
